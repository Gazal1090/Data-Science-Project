Auto Tagging of Stackoverflow Questions


## Online  question  and  answer  forums  such  asStackoverflow,Stack  Exchange  and Quora are becoming an increasingly popular resource for education. Central to the func-tionality of many of these forums is the notion of tagging, whereby a user labels his/herpost with an appropriate set of topics that describe the post, such that it is more easilyretrieved and organized.

## We present a system that is able to automatically assign tags to questions from thequestion-answering site StackOverflow,a multi-label classification system that automati-cally tags usersâ€™ questions to enhance user experience.  We have implemented aone-vs-rest classifierusinglinear support vectorandstochastic gradient descent methodsfor tagging questions with multiple labels.
