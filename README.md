Auto Tagging of Stackoverflow Questions


 Online  question  and  answer  forums  such  asStackoverflow,Stack  Exchange  and Quora are becoming an increasingly popular resource for education. Central to the functionality of many of these forums is the notion of tagging, whereby a user labels his/her post with an appropriate set of topics that describe the post, such that it is more easily retrieved and organized.

I'hv designed a system that is able to automatically assign tags to questions from the question answering site StackOverflow, a multi-label classification system that  automatically tags user's questions to enhance user experience. I have implemented a one-vs-rest classifier using linear support vector and stochastic gradient descent methods for tagging questions with multiple labels.
